# Predictive Analysis on Psychological Depression using Machine Learning

Day to day people are being aware that not just good physical health but a healthy mental health is also a primary factor for a balanced lifestyle, while there are also people who are suffering from depression but are unaware of it.

This machine learning model will predict whether the user is suffering from depression or not. The data acquired from the CDC National Health and Examination survey is information that a medical file of a patient consists of. Based on the history data of patients this model has been trained to carry out prediction analysis.

The trained model will be then used to predict if the user is suffering from depression or not and will also help them to consider whether they should seek professional help.

The carried out experiment gave an accuracy of 91.75%. Although more work is to be done in future scope to attain high accuracy. This still shows that there is a scope of utilizing this work in future for real time use.
